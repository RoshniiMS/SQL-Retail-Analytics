## 2. Customer & Geographic Insights

### State-Level Patterns
- São Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Minas Gerais (MG), and Rio Grande do Sul (RS) generate the highest orders and revenue.
- Northern states such as AC, AP, AM, RR, and RO have fewer orders but much higher delivery times and freight costs.

### City-Level Patterns
- Major cities contribute the most orders due to higher population and strong e-commerce adoption.

### Geographic Impact
- Freight cost rises sharply in remote states.
- Poor transport infrastructure leads to delayed deliveries and higher logistics expenses.
